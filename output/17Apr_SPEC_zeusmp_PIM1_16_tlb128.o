#-----------------------------Simulated Cycles Break-Up-------------------------------------------
Note:  1.(Read Cycles + Write Cycles + Read Other + Write Other) should add up to % cycles during which
          the channel is busy. This should be the same for all Ranks on a Channel
       2.(PRE_PDN_FAST + PRE_PDN_SLOW + ACT_PDN + ACT_STBY + PRE_STBY) should add up to 100%
       3.Power Down means Clock Enable, CKE = 0. In Standby mode, CKE = 1
